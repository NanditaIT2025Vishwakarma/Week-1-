# Sustainability :Waste-Management 

# Week-1
In this  we develop a Waste Management  project using AIML. Machine Learning optimizes waste management through route optimization, automated sorting , predictive analytics for forecasting waste generation, and real-time monitoring of landfills and bins. To develop this project we use Deep Learning  and CNN(Convolution Neural Network).
# Problem Statement
"The existing waste management systems are inefficient and unsustainable, leading to improper waste disposal, environmental pollution, and public health hazards."
Poor segregation of waste at the source.
Lack of awareness among citizens.
Limited Recycling infrastructure.
Overloaded landfills and open dumping.
# Objectives
To identify the major  causes of ineffective waste management.
To analyze the environmental and social impacts of poor waste handling.
To purpose sustainable solutions for improving waste collection and recycling processes.
