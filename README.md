# Week-1-
In this  we develop a Waste Management  project using AIML. Machine Learning optimizes waste management through route optimization, automated sorting , predictive analytics for forecasting waste generation, and real-time monitoring of landfills and bins. To develop this project we use Deep Learning  and CNN(Convolution Neural Network).
